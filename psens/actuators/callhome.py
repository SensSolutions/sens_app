"""
Let's assume that Destination's IP is 192.168.20.55 (box that you want to access).
You want to access from Linux client with IP 138.47.99.99.
Destination (192.168.20.55) <- |NAT| <- Source (138.47.99.99)
1. SSH from the destination to the source (with public ip) using command below:

ssh -N -R 19999:localhost:22 sourceuser@138.47.99.99

* port 19999 can be any unused port.

Remote port forwarding for anyone at work !

If you want everybody at source to be able to SSH into your destination 
machine, thereâ€™s no -g option for remote forward, so you need to change the 
SSH configuration of source, add to sshd_config :

GatewayPorts yes

2. Now you can SSH from source to destination through SSH tuneling:

ssh localhost -p 19999

3. 3rd party servers can also access 192.168.20.55 through Destination (138.47.99.99).
Destination (192.168.20.55) <- |NAT| <- Source (138.47.99.99) <- Bob's server
3.1 From Bob's server:

ssh sourceuser@138.47.99.99

3.2 After the sucessful login to Source:

ssh localhost -p 19999

* the connection between destination and source must be alive at all time.
